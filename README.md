LikeIt is a social media application that combines features from facebook, instagram, and twitter. The web application deals with client and server side. 

is an automated phishing email analysis tool based on TheHive, Cortex and MISP. It is a web application written in Python 3 and based on Flask that automates the entire analysis process starting from the extraction of the observables from the header and the body of an email to the elaboration of a verdict which is final in most cases. In addition, it allows the analyst to intervene in the analysis process and obtain further details on the email being analyzed if necessary. In order to interact with TheHive and Cortex, it uses TheHive4py and Cortex4py, which are the Python API clients that allow using the REST APIs made available by TheHive and Cortex respectively.

Download the folder
Open the terminal, split it 
Cd into server, and in the other cd into client
For the server: download the following packages:

then type npm start into the terminal

for the client, download these packages: 

then type yarn start into the terminal

The backend is connected to mongo db cloud
the server runs in port 8080
the client runs in port 3000
make sure these are free before downloading the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
